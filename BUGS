* Not a bug, but veox has trashed whitespace in some source files while trying to get it to build.
* Version string is hard-coded, not generated by CMake.
* Pressing 'm' (squads) sometimes segfaults.
* Sometimes created squads don't show names in the squads menu.
* Jobs for falling trees remain even if expanding spawning pool consumes said trees.
* Starting a new game from an already running higher-tier game leaves the higher-tier workshops available (until an unknown condition is checked).
* 100% processor usage.
* Sometimes new game starts too close to a river, items end up in water.
* Announcement window overlaps stockpile window and context menu.
* User input system could use a rewrite.
